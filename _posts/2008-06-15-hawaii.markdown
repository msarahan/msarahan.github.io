<p>Well, unless someone wakes me up, I'm drunk and asleep in Hawaii. It's a neat place, full of ridiclulous pronunciations.Â  Fortunately, I've just been to a bar with much sympathy for my complete drunkennessness (perhaps too much...).Â  Anyway, much thanks to Kim the excellent manager and ride-giver, Becky the hot bartender, and Melissa the intriguing physicist.Â  Pictures to come on Flickr- keep an eye out.Â  Only 300 or so of them to go through and properly process.Â  Fortunately, alcohol is currently interfering.Â  *thunk.*</p>
