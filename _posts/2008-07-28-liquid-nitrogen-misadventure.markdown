<p>My hard drive died. Sort of. It wouldn't work at all inside my computer. I put it into my external enclosure, just to see if it was my motherboard/SATA cable, or anything but the HDD. It worked! For 20 seconds... That got me thinking that maybe it was overheating. How better to cool it than with liquid nitrogen? I'm at school, anyway...</p>
<p>Well, one empty trash can and a quick trip to the dewar, and I had a deep-frozen hard drive that did absolutely nothing. It wouldn't turn on. I put it aside and went about disposing of the liquid nitrogen. I poured out about half of it on the floor. If you've never done this, you really should! It fizzes and little droplets dance around the floor and collect all the dust into little spots. Well, the drops raced into the hallway and fizzed menacingly. Nobody was around, thankfully, or I might have had some questions to answer. I dumped the rest onto chairs - a handy absorptive medium. Quite the opposite of a hotseat.</p>
<p>Having disposed of the cryo-liquid, I wondered if the hard drive would work again after it had warmed. These things usually have operating temperatures, and they're usually not encompassing of liquid nitrogen temperatures. I tried warming it in my jacket (while wearing it), but it was too cold for me. I stuck it back in the computer for some heat. I went off and played games for a while, came back, and had a nice, roughly 5 degree C HDD, which worked perfectly for me to salvage my files.</p>
<p>I don't recommend trying this yourself. I'm not really sane, and this wasn't really safe. Still, it is cool that it worked...</p>
