<p style="text-align: left">It's been a windy winter, and my laziness (to drive to school, rather than ride) almost cost my dear ship some major cosmetic damage. I can't help but wonder if the tree fell on him, and there was a mighty shivering of timbers, and Roger emerged victorious. I hope that's the way it worked.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">As an aside, the picture comes from a new camera - a Canon SD870IS. I bought it to mitigate some of my back problems from lugging around too much weight. It is by no means a substitute for the 20D (8 bit color depth on the 870IS vs 16 bit color on the 20D- that's a factor of 256^3 more possible colors in an image on the 20D), but it is good for things like this documentation of Roger's victory over nature.</p>
