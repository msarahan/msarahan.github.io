<p>While gathering data from my chem lab, which I've all but moved out of for anything except chemistry lab work, I needed a USB drive to pull some data from a computer.Â  Unfortunately, I left mine at home.Â  I figure no big deal, I'll see if anyone else has one.Â  Nobody else is in lab.Â  I opened a couple of drawers, found one, and went to put the data on it.Â  The one I found happened to belong to the labmate that I get along with the least.Â  Of course it corrupted the damn thing.Â  It trashed the folder I had tried to copy, and then trashed an existing folder on the drive.Â  I managed to recover everything, but some of his files don't have their names any more.Â  Just one more thing to add to the stress between us.Â  Thanks a lot, bastard-ass technology.</p>
