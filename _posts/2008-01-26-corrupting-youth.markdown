<p>I'm taking a yoga/pilates class to both stretch and strengthen my back, which has been bothering me for a while now. I arrived especially early this week, because I was late last week and was too embarrassed to barge in late and disturb class. Well, while I'm waiting, two young girls walk into the lobby - definitely high school, but I couldn't place just how old. One was complaining that her dad wouldn't let her skip school, that he was preparing her for Harvard or something (gosh!). Then she lamented her older brother going to Cal (Berkeley), setting the bar too high. She wished for a way to go nowhere, like community college. At this point, I just couldn't resist being my normal wise-ass self, and nonchalantly suggested:"Drugs are a really great way to end up nowhere fast."I later learned that the girls were 13. D'oh.</p>
