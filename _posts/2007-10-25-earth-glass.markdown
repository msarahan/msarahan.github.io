<p class="flickr-yourcomment">This one is probably sitting on Jim Hansen's desk right now. He's the NASA person who's been publicizing global warming data for many years. My dad recognized the resemblance to Earth, and vaguely suggested giving it to Jim, since he was going to see him on Wed, 10/24. I thought it was a great idea, and that it would be an honor if Jim would accept it. I hear that Jim was touched, so I guess it went well.</p>
