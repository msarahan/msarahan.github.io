<p>On the suggestion of one of my new co-op friends, I tried eating a raw garlic clove to try to nip my cold in the bud.  My body was unhappy with me the first time, and downright refused the second.  I think I'll stick to vitamins and horrible-tasting cough syrup.</p>
<p>In other news, I passed my qualifying exam.  I'm now a dissertation away from being a mad doctor.  Excitement abounds.</p>
