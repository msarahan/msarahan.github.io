=========================================<br />
Chancellor Katehi,</p>
<p>The events at the student rally on November 18 have deeply saddened and upset me.  The police - your police - demonstrated wanton and dispassionate abuse of peaceful protestors.  These are not acceptable actions for any human being, let alone representatives of a world-class facility for intellectual development and exploration.  I am appalled to be associated with a place that is host to such brutality.</p>
<p>I will be watching your reaction to these crimes carefully, and I hope your future actions and the actions of the University will sincerely reflect your supposed commitment to the Principles of Community.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Michael C Sarahan, PhD<br />
UCD Alumnus, 2010</p>
