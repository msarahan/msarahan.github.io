  content: Well, you already know how I feel about this stuff.  I'm constantly proposing
    ideas, but I have difficulty following through.  I just can't seem to get over
    the idea that once I bring it up it's in their court...just wishful thinking I
    guess, but I am realizing that I must take initiative.  The only problem is, I
    don't want to.  But I look back at my social development and I see how quiet I
    used to be.  Slowly I forced myself to talk - to take on that chit-chat/get-to-know-you
    phase, and I forced myself for a long time.  Even now I still feel it, but I'm
    also surprised to find how often it feels so much more natural now.  I'm supposing
    these things progress in stages and therefore I can only hope the rest is still
    to come.  I am trying.  Everyone tells me to try more, but I am trying.

<p>Here's a bit of speculation from conversation with a friend today.  She's a bit younger than me, but is experiencing much of the same stuff I did earlier in life - I like to be with people, and I have a great time when I am.  However, I am terrible at initiating any of that contact.  What's worse is that without that contact, I get paranoid that friends are abandoning me.  It's a very vicious degenerative loop.  I've tried pretty hard lately to get better at it, and it's getting easier, but still awkward.  I find it interesting that the capability to initiate social contact is definitely distinct from ability to interact with others, and I'm curious how many other people have issues initiating like I do.</p>
