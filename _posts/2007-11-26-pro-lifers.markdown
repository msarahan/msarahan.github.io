  content: hmm, i wonder if one of the main roadblocks towards people believing in
    evolution is the idea you've kind of played into here.  trees DON'T come into
    existence "by themselves."  evolution happens because of many environmental factors
    pulling the genome of a species in one direction or another.  it doesn't happen
    in a vacuum and it's not some sort of magical process.  it's an interdependent
    endeavor, relying on cause and effect and the actions of other organisms and non-living
    phenomena.  yes, nobody built the tree for some architectural or aesthetic purpose,
    but dividing things into "natural" and "manmade" doesn't in my opinion help explain
    life on this planet because we influence evolution too.

  content: Well, that's true.  I agree with you completely, and I guess I thought
    that idea was implied in my statements.  Evolution is the product of all environmental
    factors, and is a completely natural process - a sort of energy minimization,
    if you're a nerd chemist like me.  Though human inventions influence evolution,
    they are not products of evolution, other than the evolution of humanity to get
    us to the point of designing and constructing such buildings.  The degree of human
    influence when comparing a tree to a building is vastly different.  One is a response
    to the environment that occurred over a vast expanse of time, and the other is
    a more or less instantaneous response to some human need (which then influences
    the environment that other things respond to).

  content: "well, unless you have those crazy artificially sculpted trees, that kind
    of blurs the line a bit.\r\n\r\ni guess i'm saying that i get it, and i knew YOU
    got it, but i think that perhaps creationists hear about \"evolution\" in a simplified
    form and get this idea that the theory is stating that it's without outside influence,
    that the organisms just kind of choose to change or something.\r\n\r\nof course
    delving too far into the minds of creationists is not really something i want
    to do.  suffice to say i agreed with what you said, i just latched onto that small
    point because it occurred to me that as scientists what we leave out in explanations
    could be just as important as what we put in.  and i think the way evolution has
    been sold to some people has not been as edifying as we desperately need it to
    be right now.  a lot of people still think \"survival of the fittest\" refers
    to the biggest and strongest winning out. blegh."

<p>*Warning* Rant.  Probably offensive. Expletive free!</p>
<p>Today I did intellectual battle with an anti-abortion demonstrator.  I was mostly civil, except when he was especially boneheaded.  There are just too many cliche'd  ideas that those people use.  He was holding this enormous  (3.5'x5' or so) poster of an aborted fetus, arranged in the most disgusting way possible - head mutilated, midsection flayed, giblets strewn about.  I approached him and said "are you from a religious organization?"  He wouldn't answer that.  My point was to get at his motivation for being there.  He asked me what that had to do with anything.  I said religious people have a different definition of when something is "alive."  He argued, correctly, that I was wrong.  What was a more accurate thing to say is that religious people have a different definition for when a developing fetus is considered a human being.  So, we meandered into religion...</p>
<p>"(He points toward the building) Does that just come into existence by itself?"<br />
Obviously not.  It's a human creation.<br />
"What about that tree?"<br />
Yup, it does.  Evolution.  Buildings are not natural creations.  They are a human idea built for a human purpose.  There is no architectural natural selection.  Anyway, his point (and a common argument to many religious demonstrators I've talked to) is that creation is so complex that it had to be created by some intelligent agent.  I don't buy it - there is no proof.  I hate religion not because I am anti-God, but because religion is a cop-out.  It's believing what other people have told you, yet you have no evidence for it other than the fact that lots of other people have been following it for some time. If you "feel" God, how are you sure that it's Him, and not just a strange  nervous system phenomenon?  The brain is capable of more than we give it credit for, and certainly more than we understand.</p>
<p>He asked me what I believed in - Nothing.  Then he brought up another tired argument - "you can't believe in nothing, if you did you wouldn't do anything at all, and you'd wither in one spot.  Do you take an airplane ride believing that you'll make it to where you want to go?"  Of course.  There's a big difference in my mind between things that directly affect my life (things I trust in), and things that don't (religious beliefs, my quest for social justice).  I trust in things that are required for me to live.  I trust my food is safe to eat.  I trust that the ground will not collapse before me as I walk to class.  Furthermore, these are things that are backed by 24 years of personal experience as being safe, and by many more than that for everyone else.  God is not such a requisite belief.  My quest for social justice is also not requisite, but it is part of my identification with greater humanity as a whole.  What part of life does belief in God actually affect?  Here we came to the next topic: morals.</p>
<p>Morals do not come from religion.  They are not God's plan.  They are logical extensions and developments from people living in community.  Morals are natural laws, but they are passed down in communities through generations, and not necessarily ingrained into our genetics.  Society cannot exist without morals, and the only reason society needs religion or government is to enforce the morals on those without the consideration of community or of greater humanity (unfortunately, I think most people fall into this category). He kept on arguing that without law, there would be nothing stopping anyone from killing anyone else.  How about animals, he said.  Animals kill each other.  Sure, but do they kill their den-mates?  Do they kill their pack?  You must consider pack animals for this, because morals are a product of and a necessity for community.  My argument is that with any reflection at all, one becomes aware that everything falls apart without the natural law.  Not many people would kill each other without laws because it's not productive.  It doesn't take society (or any individual) anywhere for long.  Every so often, people kill others because of resources, possessions, wronged relatives, etc.  This totally destroys the community - paranoia arises and the tendency to generalize and classify people as threats runs wild.  Until people recover their trust that everyone is following the rules (morals, natural law), there is less community, in the sense of people participating in society outside their homes.  If there were anarchy, there would be no community.  I think it is like communism - it's a good idea in principle, but scale and human greed prevent it from succeeding.  Just because we have law to enforce the rules and religion to remind people of them does not mean that the morals originated in either.  Is religion anything more than "best practice" for some extended period of time, with the threat of some higher power to intimidate and influence people?  I suppose it is also mental support in rough times for people who can't get enough support from friends/family, or can't muster the strength to solve their problem alone.  I don't disapprove of that, but I'll save any further thought on that for another day.</p>
<p>Religion for morals, religion for explaining complexity - both are an unwillingness to question, to genuinely seek truth.  I don't give a rat's ass about abortion.  I just wish people wouldn't hold disgusting signs up right outside the cafeteria.  It's not like I belch in church when the priest is breaking the bread.</p>
