    of your trip goes just as well =)\r\n\r\nYeah, those pacific islanders do have
    strange pronunciations.  I read a book called Typee a couple of years back.  I
    still haven't figured out how to pronounce the title, and I felt like a kindergartener
    while trying to read it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, have fun! ...I can't wait to see all the
    pics."

<p>Last night I was (obviously from my last post) very drunk - and this is the best story I've had in quite a while.Â  I locked myself out of my dorm room!Â  I wandered around the building for a while, tried to force the door open, but ended up finding a stash of extra blankets and passing out on a couch in the lounge area.Â  Very funny, and a great introduction to a science meeting!</p>
