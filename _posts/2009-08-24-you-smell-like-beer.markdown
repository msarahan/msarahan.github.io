  content: I'm going to speculate it's because their only experience with beer has
    been with kegs at frat parties...

<p>Funny encounter today with some jailbait at the Woodstocks bar.  Here's how it went:</p>
<p>(2 young girls walk up next to me at the bar, and are wondering what the trinkets in the glass at the bar are)<br />
Me: "those are bottle openers."<br />
Them: "you smell like beer."<br />
Me: "that's because I'm drinking it."</p>
<p>The real question, though, is how they know what beer smells like, but don't know what a bottle opener looks like.  Hmmmm....</p>
