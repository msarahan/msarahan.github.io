<p>For those of you who've seen Hollywood's latest pile of poo on my childhood cultural icons:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=241">VG Cats comic</a></p>
<p>That comic pretty well captures my sentiments.&nbsp; It did a great job of bastardizing the franchise in the name of quick entertainment.&nbsp; I don't know why I expected anything more - perhaps it's the optimist that I've tried to tie up, suffocate and drown deep inside.&nbsp; Thanks a lot Hollywood, for showing that poor little remnant of happy me how undeserved its faint glimmer of faith is.</p>
