<p>Just in case you ever need to politely respond to one of these...</p>
<p>1. On receipt of a telephoned bomb threat:<br />
  (a) Try to be calm and courteous.<br />
  (b) If at all possible keep the caller talking, for example, by pretending difficulty in hearing, and repeat all the information you receive alound</p>
<p>2. Try to find out:<br />
  (a) Exactly where is the bomb?<br />
  (b) When will it go off?<br />
  (c) What does it look like?<br />
  (d) What organization do they represent or why are they making the threat?<br />
  (e) How does the bomb work?<br />
  (f) Where is the caller phoning from?</p>
