<p>Sarah Palin is coming to Houston!  Yippeee!</p>
<p>"Sarah Palin made history as the first woman ever to be elected Governor of Alaska, and the youngest person to ever hold that office.Her straightforward, no-nonsense approach to politics and life captivated the nation and jettisoned her new book to an instant mega-bestseller. "</p>

<p>I think jettisoning her book is the only appropriate action for it, though I worry about overflowing landfills.</p>
<p>Courtesy of Answer.com, the definition of jettison:<br />
<em>verb</em><br />
To let go or get rid of as being useless or defective, for example: discard, dispose of, dump, junk, scrap, throw away, throw out. <em>Informal</em> chuck, shuck (off). <em>Slang</em> ditch.</p>
<p><em>noun</em><br />
The act of getting rid of something useless or used up: disposal, dumping, elimination, riddance.</p>
<p><strong><em>jettison</em></strong> indeed.</p>
